### Project started at the internship and remade (& completed) afterwards. Should work nicely in mobile version (320px-700px) and desktop version (701px-1366px, probably even bigger). No JavaScript. Everybody had to map a website themselves and mentors only showed us good practices and guided us slightly towards better code-writing.

# Webpack Frontend Starterkit

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/wbkd/webpack-starter.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

A lightweight foundation for your next webpack based frontend project.


### Installation

```
npm install
```

### Start Dev Server

```
npm start
```

### Build Prod Version

```
npm run build
```

### Features:

* ES6 Support via [babel](https://babeljs.io/) (v7)
* SASS Support via [sass-loader](https://github.com/jtangelder/sass-loader)
* Linting via [eslint-loader](https://github.com/MoOx/eslint-loader)

When you run `npm run build` we use the [mini-css-extract-plugin](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/mini-css-extract-plugin) to move the css to a separate file. The css file gets included in the head of the `index.html`.
